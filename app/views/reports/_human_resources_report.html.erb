Interview-to-hire ratio – This indicates the number of interviews a hiring manager had to conduct before making an offer. It’s a useful metric to include because it shows how many hours were spent on interviewing. It also indicates whether or not the correct sourcing methods are used, the clarity of the job advert, and alignment between the recruiter and hiring manager.

New hire turnover – This is the percentage of employees that leave your company during a certain period, usually the first year. To calculate new hire turnover, divide the number of new hires who left by the total number of employees who left in that same period. This measures the quality of your onboarding program and how aligned your job is with the new hire. It’s also an indication of how healthy your organizational culture is because if you have too many people leaving in the first year, then you know something is wrong.

Attrition rate – In simple terms, attrition is the rate employees leave. To get to this rate, divide the number of employees who left by the average headcount in that same period and express it as a percentage. An annual view of your attrition rate indicates how good or bad your company is at keeping talent, how attractive your brand is and how engaging your programs are.

Exit drivers – After a year of work, it’s interesting to note what made people leave the organization. Is it due to salary? Career opportunities? Poor management? Your exit drivers are an effective way to review your HR efforts and priorities for the next year in terms of your HR strategy. Collect this information by what people indicate in their exit surveys as the reason for leaving.

Absenteeism rate – The absenteeism rate is a key measure of organizational health and well-being. Knowing the exact absence rate will help shape interventions.
